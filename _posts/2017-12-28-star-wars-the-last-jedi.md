The latest addition to the Star Wars cinematic universe was released in mid December to claim the fifth largest box office opening night of all time at $450 million.

Fan and critical reviews of the film have been incredibly mixed. On the popular film review site Rotten Tomatoes, critics have given the film a 91% fresh rating, while the audience score has been split at 51%. Some parts of the [alt-right have apparently taken responsibility](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/rotten-tomatoes-last-jedi-ratings-bots_us_5a38cb78e4b0860bf4aab5b1) for the poor audience reviews, with claims of using bots to spam rotten tomatoes with bad reviews.

We took the time to collect as much data from rotten tomatoes and IMDB as possible. Here's what we found. 

## Star Ratings: 

Both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB employ a star-rating system. Rotten Tomatoes rates films out of 5 stars, and IMDB rates films on a 10 star scale. In the analysis, we set both sites to a 5 star scale so they can be directly compared.  

### Reviews are mixed: 2 out of 5 stars

After examining the star ratings for both sites, it appears that IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes are largely in agreement. The average scores for both sites are statistically similar, at around 2 out of 5 stars.

Compared to Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB gave more reviews at around the 3 star level. So it looks like Rotten Tomatoes reviewers are more split about the film than those on IMDB.

## Men and Women give similar ratings

We used a model to predict the reviewers gender from around 800 of the reviews. The gender split that we found is graphed below. From those gendered reviews, we can take a look at the star ratings to see whether men or women preferred the film.

While women rated the film 0.2 stars higher on average, the star rating distributions are still largely similar, so the results are not statistically significant.

## Political Views

Many reviewers took issue with the film for political reasons. Here are a few extracts from reviews that emphasise this point.

# Limitations

- We weren't able to collect all of the reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, the site only provides online access to the first 300 reviews or so.
